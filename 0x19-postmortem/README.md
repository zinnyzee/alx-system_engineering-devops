# Issue Summary

While in the vagrant environment trying to conclude a given task on my system on 12th December 2022 at 1:35 pm (West Africa Standard Time), I noticed my battery icon was not displayed on the taskbar as usual then I tried several means to locate and display it all to no avail. still in the process at about 2:40 my system abruptly shut down without notice. I tried the power button to see if it will come up but it proved abortive. Then I assumed it was a low battery, this prompted me to plug in the power cable but I noticed the system was not charging hence, its refusal to boot.
The root cause of the sudden shutdown was a hardware failure of the system battery.


# Timeline (West Africa Standard Time)

* 1:35 pm: Notice of missing battery icon on the taskbar
* 1:36 pm: An attempt to locate the battery icon proved abortive
* 1:45 pm: Abrupt shutdown of the system
* 5:05 pm: Replacement of the system battery
* 5:07 pm: Charging of replacement battery
* 6:30 pm: Successful charge and booting of the system


# Root Cause

The abrupt shutdown of the system was due to battery failure which was caused by incessant charging without unplugging the power cable even when it has fully charged. Also, it was noticed that oftentimes the battery does not fully discharge before plugging the power cable for a recharge.


# Resolution and recovery

When the incident occurred, the system was taken to a manufacturerâ€™s workshop where it was worked upon, the actual cause was identified and attributed to battery failure, and a recommendation was made for a replacement. The replacement battery was paid for, delivered, and fixed after which it was charged and powered on and the system successfully booted.



# Corrective and Preventive Measures
* The power cable should be unplugged once the battery is fully charged.

* Batteries should be charged only when it has fully discharged or below 10%.

* Ensure power cables are in working condition.

* A backup battery should be available
